# Regression-Boston-Dataset
This project was pure testing of regression techniques. One easy datasets used are that is Boston dataset.
# Dataset

Dataset used in this project is the part of Scikit-learn library. You can add them to your code with next lines:
from sklearn import datasets
boston_data = datasets.load_boston() #For boston dataset

# Code
The code used in this project is inside Linear and Lasso Regression - Boston .ipynb.
# Run
To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).
After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:
ipython notebook Linear and Lasso Regression - Boston.ipynb
or
jupyter notebook Linear and Lasso Regression - Boston.ipynb
